## Purpose
This was my first attempt at a practical/useful webapp. It is made in raw html/css/js, using html canvas for the pixel art canvas, and includes features like flood fill, and shapes (rect filled/rect unfilled). Though it was simple it also includes the addition of a TeachableMachine model which rates your pixel art (press the award icon in the bottom bar), but the model only includes a handful of example pixel art pieces making it not very good. You can try drawing a tropical island in the ocean with a palm tree to get a high score, as that is one of the prompt images I gave.
